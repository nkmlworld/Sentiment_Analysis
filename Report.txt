Dataset:
Dataset is collected from Kaggle including IMDB movie reviews as per requirement.
Had two columns `reviews` and `sentiment` and 50000 observations in total. No null values observed as well as dataset is equally balanced for both the available classes.

Preprocessing:
Preprocessing involved cleaning the reviews as they contained lots of un necessary html tags, stop words, punctuation marks and make the dataset in lowercase.

Model:
Compared the different model`s results and found out that Random Forest really did well as 
Confusion matrix is like below.
Model	Accuracy	Precision 	Recall	F1-Score	Confusion Matrix
Na√Øve Bayes	0.6565
	0.6643
	0.6565
	0.6552
	[[697 255]
 [431 614]]

Random Forests	0.8302
	0.8306
	0.8302
	0.8303
	[[793 159]
 [180 865]]

SVM	0.8282
	0.8286
	0.8282
	0.8283
	[[792 160]
 [183 862]]



Challenges Faced:
Data became too large after the feature engineering part, so due to limited hardware and computing resources needed to slice the data.
